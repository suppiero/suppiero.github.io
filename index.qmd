### About Me

Hello üëãüèΩ My name is Piero Trujillo and welcome to my website!

I recently graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I received a Bachelor's Degree in Statistics & Data Science.

I possess extensive experience programming in Python and R, as well as intermediate proficiency with managing relational databases in SQL and large-scale data processing in PySpark.

In my spare time, you can find me playing soccer, getting my hands dirty in ceramics, whipping up culinary delights in the kitchen, or indulging my inner foodie with friends downtown.
